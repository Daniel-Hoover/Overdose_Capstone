# Overdose Trends Across the US and Tennessee
*What trends are observed with overdose fatalities across the US and are these trends seen within Tennessee?*
## Motivation and Data Question

When we were learning SQL we did a project about prescribers within Tennessee. We discovered a man named David Coffey who was prescribing vastly more medications than any other doctor. Someone in our class looked him up and realized that he had been arrested fairly recently for drug trafficking. This coupled with various miniseries coming about about the opioid crisis I began to wonder if drug overdose trends of Tennessee were unique. With this project, I wanted to see if these trends with durgs were localized or reflective of the country as a whole.

##Research and Results
I started my analysis by compliling data sets of drug overdoes observed at the country level from government websites. Then I complied State level data. Sifting through both data sets, I looked for drugs that were compared across both. The drugs I tracked were reported across all sets of data. The other important factor that I needed across all the data sets was location data. The Tennessee data only got as granular as large metro areas.

##Main Findings
-Across the United states and Tennessee overdoes trends mirror each other. Areas of high populations will consistently report higher rates of overdose
-On both Country and State levels the most likely drug involved in overdoses are opioids. This is likely due to availability.
-90% of states have shown an increased confidence in testing for drugs involved in overdoses
-Nonfatal overdoses are more often treated through outpatient procedures
-Tennessee displays higher rates of stimulant abuse than the country as a whole.
